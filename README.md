When you open the project, you begin on the login page. Here, a user enters information such as their name or login details. After pressing submit, this data is sent to the database and added to the SQL tables so the system knows who is logged in. The user is then taken to the menu page.

On the menu page, all restaurant options and food items are displayed. The user can browse the menu, select what they want, and click Add to Cart for any items they wish to order. Once they have made their selections, they continue to the checkout page.

At the checkout page, the user enters payment details like card number, expiration date, and security code. This step simulates a real payment process, and when the user finishes, the payment information is saved in the database. After submitting, the system sends the user to the thank you page.

The thank you page displays a confirmation message, thanking the user for their purchase. It can also show details such as the user's name, total amount, or items ordered. This page confirms that the customer’s details, order, and payment information have been recorded in the database.
